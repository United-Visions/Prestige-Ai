# AI SDK Setup Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved
Fixed critical AI SDK dependency error and model selection confusion that was preventing Prestige AI from creating functional apps.

### Root Causes
1. **Dependency Error**: The failed app was trying to install non-existent packages:
   - `@ai-sdk/core@^0.0.15` - **This package does not exist**
   - `@ai-sdk/google@^0.0.15` - Wrong version (should be 2.0.12+)

2. **Model Selection Confusion**: Prestige AI was suggesting OpenAI setup when building user apps, even though the scaffold is specifically configured for Google Gemini.

### Source of Problems
- `scaffold/AI_RULES.md` incorrectly documented `@ai-sdk/core` as a required package
- System prompt didn't enforce scaffold's AI configuration
- Prestige AI was suggesting the same model/provider the user selected for Prestige AI itself, instead of respecting the scaffold's configuration

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed scaffold/AI_RULES.md**:
   - Removed reference to non-existent `@ai-sdk/core`
   - Updated to correctly reference `ai` (the main package) and `@ai-sdk/google`
   - Made AI configuration more explicit with "CRITICAL" and "ONLY" directives
   - Emphasized that scaffold is SPECIFICALLY configured for Google Gemini

2. **Enhanced system prompt** (`src/prompts/system_prompt.ts`):
   - Added "SCAFFOLD AI CONFIGURATION ENFORCEMENT" section
   - Prevents suggesting wrong AI providers when building from scaffold
   - Ensures Prestige AI respects scaffold's AI configuration regardless of user's model choice

### Correct AI SDK Setup (According to Official Docs)

#### Required Packages:
- `ai` (main package) - âœ… Already in scaffold
- `@ai-sdk/google` - âœ… Already in scaffold  
- `@ai-sdk/react` (for React hooks) - Not needed in scaffold as it uses vanilla functions

#### Package Versions:
- `"ai": "^5.0.33"` âœ…
- `"@ai-sdk/google": "^2.0.12"` âœ…

### Testing Results
- âœ… Scaffold installs successfully with `npm install`
- âœ… AI SDK imports work correctly in `src/lib/ai.ts`
- âœ… No version conflicts or missing packages

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Test scaffold installation
cd scaffold && npm install

# Verify AI SDK packages exist
npm view ai versions --json | tail -5
npm view @ai-sdk/google versions --json | tail -5

# Confirm @ai-sdk/core doesn't exist
npm view @ai-sdk/core versions --json  # Should return 404
```

### Prevention
- AI agents should never suggest `@ai-sdk/core` package
- Always use `ai` as the main AI SDK package
- Verify package existence before adding dependencies
- Reference official AI SDK documentation for correct setup

### Files Changed
- `scaffold/AI_RULES.md` - Fixed incorrect AI SDK documentation and emphasized Gemini-only configuration
- `src/prompts/system_prompt.ts` - Added scaffold AI configuration enforcement rules

### Next Steps
1. âœ… Test scaffold installs correctly
2. âœ… Verify AI SDK imports work
3. ðŸ”„ Test creating new apps through Prestige AI agent
4. ðŸ”„ Monitor for any remaining dependency issues

## MongoDB Setup Status
- âœ… MongoDB configuration is correct
- âœ… `mongodb-memory-server@10.1.2` in devDependencies works properly
- âœ… Database setup in `src/lib/db.ts` is properly configured
