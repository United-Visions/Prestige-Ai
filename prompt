I have cloned the CCdyad repository (https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/CCdyad) to my current directory for investigation. I want to create a simple clone of this project with a focus specifically on how they integrated Claude Code as the model agent.
Project Goal: Create "Prestige-AI" - a simplified version of CCdyad that replicates the basic functionality, interface, and layouts.
Key Requirements:

Investigate the current CCdyad codebase in the cloned directory
Focus specifically on how they integrated Claude Code (not API methods)
Understand their workflow where users can:

Activate the Claude Code agent
Create a new app by sending a prompt
Have the agent follow similar prompt patterns to CCdyad
Generate new local repositories in a similar manner



Main Investigation Points:

How CCdyad figured out a way to use Claude Code as a modal within the dyad app
Their integration method (since it's not using API calls)
According to Anthropic's docs, Claude Code focuses on installing and connecting to the Claude Code CLI tool, but CCdyad has implemented it differently

Deliverable:
Create a comprehensive document outlining everything that needs to be done to build this Prestige-AI version. I'll be using VS Code for development.
Note: The current focus should be understanding how CCdyad integrated Claude Code CLI as a modal component rather than traditional API integration, and replicating that workflow approach.
